Who am I?

I am a hobbyist programmer, I had the first contact with the Java language when I was 17 years old, I enroll in a technical course about programming logic and Java, afterward, I worked in many IT centered companies, such as International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard, however, never as a programmer. Nowadays, I live in San Diego and in my spare time, I program to study and share my development with other programmer fellows.

What is the objective of this program?

The program had the objective of emulating the Windows native application notepad. It was programmed using Java, the objective was to study the JavaFX platform and how it relates to the deprecated Swing library. The function that are programmed now are, the ability to open and save files with the extension .xtreme; gather all fonts available in the user system, and show in a ComboBox all the compatible ones; the ability to change the font size, with a predetermined sizes; the option to change the current font family between the FontWeight.Normal, FontWeight.Bold, and FontPosture.Italic. My experience as aforementioned is limited in a corporate environment, however, from the tests that I conduct in this first version, I could not detect a bug, nevertheless, the stability is not guarantee. I belive that the objective was in part achieved, and I hope that this study can influence another hobbyist to pursue their dreams.
